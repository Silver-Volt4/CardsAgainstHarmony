# Cards Against Harmony

(because Cards Against Discord is a disallowed name and Harmony is the opposite of Discord)

CAH is a Discord bot that allows you to play Cards Against Humanity in your Discord chat.

## Features
- fully playable using text chat and Interactions
- makes use of private threads to keep the sins away from the eyes of the innocent
- support for custom decks and free mixing of multiple decks

## Great, how do I invite this?
Right now you don't. You can clone the repository and host the bot yourself, but you will have to import your own cards into the database.
I plan on adding Google Sheets import at some point in the future.
